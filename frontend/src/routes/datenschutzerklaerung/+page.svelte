	<h2 id="mOverview">Overview of Processing Activities</h2>
	<p>
		The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing and refers to the data subjects.
	</p>
	<h3>Types of Data Processed</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Usage data</li>
		<li>Meta, communication, and procedural data</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Categories of Data Subjects</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Users</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Purposes of Processing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Security measures</li>
		<li>Provision of our online offering and user-friendliness</li>
		<li>Information technology infrastructure</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="m13">Relevant Legal Bases</h3>
	<p>
		The following is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases apply in individual cases, we will inform you of them in the privacy policy.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains specific provisions on the right to access, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and the transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. It also regulates the data processing for employment purposes (§ 26 BDSG), especially regarding the establishment, implementation, or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
	</p>
	<h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
	<p>
		We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
	</p>
	<p>
		The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, transmission, ensuring availability, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. We also consider the protection of personal data already during the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, according to the principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.
	</p>
	<h2 id="m12">Deletion of Data</h2>
	<p>
		The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their permitted consents are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g., if the purpose of the processing of this data has ceased or they are not necessary for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be limited to these purposes. I.e., the data is locked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our privacy notices may also contain further details on the retention and deletion of data, which apply primarily to the respective processing operations.
	</p>
	<h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
	<p>
		Cookies are small text files or other storage markers that store information on end devices and read information from end devices. For example, to store the login status in a user account, a shopping cart content in an e-shop, the content accessed, or the functions used of an online offer. Cookies can also be used for different purposes, e.g., for the functionality, security, and comfort of online offerings as well as for the creation of analyses of visitor flows.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Notes on consent:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with the legal requirements. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, except where it is not required by law. Consent is particularly not necessary if the storage and reading of the information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary to provide the telemedia service expressly requested by the user (i.e., our online offer). The revocable consent will be clearly communicated to the users and contain the information on the respective cookie use.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Notes on data protection legal bases:</strong> The legal basis under which we process the users' personal data with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If the users agree, the legal basis for processing their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., in the commercial operation of our online offer and its improvement) or if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Storage duration:</strong> The following types of cookies are distinguished concerning the storage duration:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed their end device (e.g., browser or mobile application).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the end device has been closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, the data collected with the help of cookies can be used to measure the reach. Unless we provide explicit information on the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage duration can be up to two years.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>General information on revocation and opposition (opt-out):</strong> Users can revoke their consent at any time and also object to processing in accordance with the legal requirements of Art. 21 GDPR. Users can also declare their objection through the settings of their browser, e.g., by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby the functionality of our online services may be restricted). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared via the websites <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://optout.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Further notes on processing processes, procedures, and services:</strong></p>
	<ul class="m-elements">
		<li>
			<strong>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent:</strong> We use a cookie consent management procedure in which users' consents to the use of cookies or the processing and providers mentioned in the context of the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained, managed, and revoked by the users. In this context, the consent declaration is stored so that it does not have to be retrieved again and the consent can be proven in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can be server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie or with the help of comparable technologies) to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual details of the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of the consent can be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers), as well as the browser, system, and end device used.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="m225">Provision of the Online Offering and Web Hosting</h2>
	<p>
		We process users' data to be able to provide our online services to them. For this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary to deliver the content and functions of our online services to the user's browser or device.
	</p>
	<ul class="m-elements">
		<li>
			<strong>Processed data types:</strong> Usage data (e.g., visited websites, interest in content, access times); Meta, communication, and procedural data (e.g., IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Data subjects:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Provision of our online offering and user-friendliness; Information technology infrastructure (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices (computers, servers, etc.)); Security measures.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Further notes on processing processes, procedures, and services:</strong></p>
	<ul class="m-elements">
		<li>
			<strong>Provision of the online offering on rented storage space:</strong> For the provision of our online offering, we use storage space, computing capacity, and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a corresponding server provider (also called "web hoster"); <strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Collection of access data and log files:</strong> Access to our online offering is logged in the form of so-called "server log files". The server log files can include the address and name of the accessed websites and files, the date and time of access, transmitted data volumes, messages about successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), and IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g., to avoid server overload (especially in the case of misuse attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the stability of the servers; <strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR); <strong>Deletion of data:</strong> Logfile information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further retention is required for evidence purposes is excluded from deletion until the respective incident is finally clarified.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="m328">Plugins and Embedded Functions and Content</h2>
	<p>
		We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics, videos, or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").
	</p>
	<p>
		The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the users, as they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content or functions. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the user's device and contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit times, and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.

			<strong>Google Fonts (retrieval from Google server):</strong> Retrieval of fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of a technically secure, maintenance-free, and efficient use of fonts and symbols regarding timeliness and loading times, their uniform display, and consideration of possible licensing restrictions. The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address to provide the fonts in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) is transmitted, which is necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data can be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offer, the users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the cascading style sheets (CSS) of Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the user to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referrer URL (i.e., the website on which the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referrer URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families that the user wants to load fonts for. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. The user agent must adapt the font generated for the respective browser type to the Google Fonts Web API. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregated usage statistics to measure the popularity of font families. These aggregated usage statistics are published on the Google Fonts "Analytics" page. Finally, the referrer URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregated report on the top integrations can be generated based on the number of font requests. According to its information, Google does not use any information collected by Google Fonts to create profiles of end-users or to display targeted advertisements; <strong>Service provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR); <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://fonts.google.com/</a>; <strong>Privacy policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>; <strong>Further information:</strong> <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en</a>.
